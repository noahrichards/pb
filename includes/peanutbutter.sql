First, you can only group by a column that you have selected.  OK, fair enough.  Second, you can group by an expression, provided that you have that exact same expression as a selected value.  Makes sense, for efficency reasons.  But this one miffs me: you _cannot_ select by an alias.  You have to include the entire expression as it appears in the beginning of the select statement, verbatim. ');

Editing/saving posts is now a bit more mature, and everything site-wide is getting the urlencode() and mysql_escape_string() treatment.  I turned off magic quotes, since I don''t want to depend on that crutch.  Also, there are now 3 classes of user (besides ''visitor''): normal, admin, and siteadmin.  ''normal'' can post messages to projects and edit/delete their own posts.  ''admin'', in addition, can add projects, manage posts (edit/delete) from their own projects, and post news events.  ''siteadmin'' can manage all projects.\r\nSo the next thing to do is add project add/edit/delete, and then user change password, and then submit news events.  After that will be a page for user-class specific functions. ''normal users will have a page where they can view all their posts and change their password.  ''admin'' users, in addition, will have a page where they can see all their projects to manage, add new projects, and post news.  ''siteadmin'' user(s), in addition, will have a page to add/delete users.\r\nBig dreams.  This may take about a week to finishing.

The first is doable, but not a good idea for numerous reasons, and the second doesn''t make sense, when considering that there are multiple qual types.\r\nMy biggest question is, "When will the new IT system be ready?"

I''m not quite sure what to make of these requests and how necessary they are.\r\nIt''s like this: if you are getting air-conditioning installed next week, you don''t go out and buy and window-mounted air-conditioner to hold you over for the week; you buy a fan.');

Ah well, here are my initial observations:\r\n\r\n1) For the recipes I''m looking at, it looks like the tool is running through a sequence of 9 steps, 3 times.  However, it doesn''t give a sequence start at the beginning of each of those 3 times.  So, I can''t use the delta between sequence start and sequence step 1 as pattern rec time, and I can''t use sequence step to sequence step as MAM time.  There is an event that seems to surround the pattern rec time, however ("2004/11/03 13:38:39.133 I CSeq::enter_ST_PREP_SUBSTR()" -> "2004/11/03 13:41:53.242 I CSeq::enter_ST_PREP_DONE()").  After this, the tool goes right into the sequence steps.  I figure I can take average MAM time by taking only deltas of a sequence step _n_ to sequence step _n1 > n_.\r\n\r\n2) I have 3 tables now: HRPTimes (with the data listed above), HRPIdle, and HRPDeskew.  Since the deskew events occur multiple times for each recipe, I figure its best just to have a database of all the deskew misses (with timestamp, recipe name, score, target x&y, found x&y, and delta x&y).  This should allow for some useful statistical operation.\r\n\r\n3) The 627 KB files make up about 12 hours.  In an example 12 hour period, there are 8 lots run.  It is going to be painful to parse through all of these files.  Most of the information here is not being used, and so I''ll have to make sure I''m ignoring just about everything.\r\n\r\nMore info to follow.');

Ironically, this is the first day since I began work on this project that I haven''t touched anything yet.\r\nRegardless of the reasons, the database slowing down has retroactively caused APC Trend to slow, which is holding up the IT system resources, which is blah blah blah.  The moral of the story is no work on this report until Rebecca tells me things are in working order again.');

In order:\r\n1)The ''languages'' field has been changed to ''keywords'', which is a bit more useful.  I still denote languages within that field, but now I can use it with...\r\n2)...user-defined searches.  Test out a few keyword searches, and if you like the results, you can save that search for later use.\r\nThe idea is this: let''s say I have a CS project for Programming Language Concepts.  I give it the following keywords: \r\ncomputer science, project, programming language concepts, plc\r\nNow, let''s say I do likewise for other computer science work, giving them keywords such as computer science, homework, project, [classname], paper, etc.  Now, I can create a custom search for, say, "project", which will show me all of my projects.  Or, I can create a custom search for a given class, to see all the work I have for that class.\r\nIn terms of Infineon, keywords can include things like toolset, department, toolowner, etc.  Searches can then be performed on those keywords, and saved if they are used often.\r\nHopefully this will help with the eventual bloat.  I don''t like increasing the complexity too much, but this minor increase (an added <select> box in the Projects page and search management in the Project Management page) should have some strong benefits.');

As of now, this table does not exist, and the only interaction with the database is the ''normal'' user interaction.  \r\nThe searching isn''t yet active, due to my having to adjust to the ASP model of devlopment.  For example, in PHP, I have this nice class structure for creating sql Matches and MatchCollections.  Because of the beautiful php arrays and weak typing, its all rather concise code that I''ve used in quite a few web apps (including PB, of all things).  Well, since I''m using ASP, I can forget the class model.  Of course, I could ''upgrade'' to ASP.NET and C#, but then I would have to be hardcore OO (rather than the mixing that is allowed with the php methodologies; OO when you want/need it, procedural when you don''t).

Not so much an epiphany, as there was relatively little change to my life, but it was still enlightening.  So, without further ado, here it is:\r\n[i]All of the people who are writing horribly invovled metalanguages for creating web pages and blogs are making the problem worse, not better.[/i]\r\nI came upon a language system yesterday that was written by the IT department (or at least an IT professor) at RIT.  It is called Molly, and can be found here:~\r\nhttp://molly.rit.edu/\r\nIt is, by far, one of the dumbest things I have ever seen.  Basically, to do anything of import with it, you have to use php.  Also, it seems to have a near 1-1 correspondence with common php functions.  It requires you learn a dialect of XML to use (MAML, or the Molly Active Markup Language), in addition to php for the more "advanced" features.  Everything that is supposed be done for you ("Windoids" and "Apploids", how cool!!!!!!1one) are really just some php code that is accessed by the super-special XML tags.  So what is the moral of this story?\r\n[b]Using Molly requires far more work than just writing the php![/b]\r\nIt doesn''t save you any knowledge base, since you still have to have the same set of information you need to write it in php, and you still write about as much code in php, although its in special MAML tags instead of php.  It doesn''t save you redundant code.  It doesn''t do anything spectacular.  It just translates MAML to php/xml/css, which could just as easily have been donee with php/xml/css.\r\nI''ve been looking for uber-cool blogging platforms for about a year now.  I''ve tried everything from the online offerings to WordPress and MovableType.  After using them all, I''ve realized that it is much/more easier/effective/simple/efficient to write it yourself, in the server-side language of your choice, than to use a pre-rolled version.\r\nAnd that''s when it really hit me: ever since I''ve been here, I''ve been rolling around the idea of creating some type of automatic script generator for people to use when I''m gone, but I''m looking at things all backwards.\r\nIn order to use this automatic script generator, they would have to learn how to use it, which would probably require knowledge of regular expressions for parsing.  In addition, in thinking of the types of logical complexities that these projects require, there would have to be a good deal of complexity built into the generator.  So here''s the point: that is what scripting languages were invented for!\r\nTcl, Perl, and Python were all built to be a simpler way of using more difficult things like C/C++.  They make things easier (this is arguable for Tcl) than going through the rounds of using a lower-level, compiled language, just as compiled languages make things easier than writing in machine code.\r\nI''ve realized that you can only abstract so much of the complexity away.  Making an automatic script generator would be more like creating a scripting language for a scripting language, but the scripting languages are already abstracted out about as far as they can go and still be useful.\r\nThat''s the juice.

I think it began as a rebellion against the uselessness, in most cases, of having the unique integer identifier that auto-increments, especially when these same columns have unique names or combinations of information.  Besides, using an id also breaks the "REPLACE INTO" of mysql, since it actually does a "DELETE" and then an "INSERT".\r\nWell kids, I''ve now come to see the light.  Having that autoincrement is awesome when you need to link tables in which all of the data associated with the row in a table can be modified.  For example, I can change every piece of information about a project on PB, including the name.  So, even though the name is unique, it is not unchangeable.  Before now, whenever I changed the project name, I went through and updated the blog to reflect that change (as the tables were linked by project name).\r\nWell, now things have been improved.  The blog table contains `projid`, which is the associated project id.  Now, a change in the project name does not affect the blog, and I can still get the project id with the blog events by doing a JOIN on the `pb_projects` table.  Also, creating/editing/saving/deleting posts and projects is a bit cleaner; rather than passing around lots of information (like title, author, and project for posts), I just pass around the id.  `pb_blog` and `pb_projets` both have this id, and I''m considering adding an id column to `pb_searches`, although I probably won''t, since the search name has to be unique anyways, and it doesn''t link with any other tables.\r\nThe other change is to get rid of `pb_news`, which was basically just a copy of `pb_blog`, and place all the news posts in `pb_blog` with a `projid` of -1.  Since the auto-incrementing will never hit -1, there will never be a ''real'' project with id = -1.  This way, for the news, I just:\r\n[i]SELECT * FROM `pb_blog` WHERE `projid` = ''-1'';[/i]\r\n...and for the latest posts, I just:\r\n[i]SELECT * FROM `pb_blog` WHERE `projid` != ''-1'';[/i]\r\nMy only problem now is that some of the pages show results of mysql queries by simply displaying the column name->value pairs from mysql_fetch_assoc(), which now shows ids (which I don''t want) and projectids for posts (which makes no sense to the user).  I''ve just updated the postConfirmDelete.php page, and will fix up others as I notice them.');

I ran into a few snags, such as figuring out how to get the most recent files; the files are ordered numerically/sequentially, and, since the tool saves these sequentially, I assumed the modification times on the files would be as well.  Well, I was wrong.  Turns out, the tool decided to start over with the logs, so the log files from 1 -> 429 are ordered correctly up until log# 429, which is current, and the log files from 455 -> 549 are from 2004.  Thank you, miss HRP-220. The genius thing in all of this is that the integer compononet of the file name is a zero-padded [i]5 digit integer[/i].  This means, you guessed it, that the tool has the capability of storing [i]100,000[/i] logs in sequential order without starting over (from 00000-99999).  Of course, starting over after about 500 logs makes much more sense.  Who am I to judge?\r\nRegardless, the parser appears to be working correctly.  I''m not sure if Eric needs more information than I am currently capturing (i.e. I capture the run time of a recipe, but not the number of wafers/sequence steps/deskews/etc.), so I''ll need him to look over things before I can get a definite "This is what I need."

Luckily, like the speed at which little Buster ages, there is a nice direct correlation between IT time and real time: whatever date they give, add 3 +/-1 weeks to the date, and you will have an accurrate estimate.\r\nRegardless, they have waited too long for me to comfortably meet the requirements they will most likely give to me.  For example, the easiest part of this entire process will be moving the database over, as it will require minimal change in coding logic (mssql doesn''t have such things as ''INSERT IGNORE'' and ''REPLACE INTO''), a simple change of Tcl packages (from ''mysqltcl'' to ''tclodbc''), and a minor change in syntax (mysql''s ''`'' to denote database/table/field names gets translated to ''['' and '']'' in mssql syntax).  This whole process should take about a week (for each database, dump the database from mysql to either .csv or to sql and import that file into mssql), but that will be a week devoted to that.  I have only 5-6 weeks left here, and 1/5 or 1/6 of that time is quite a bit.\r\nThe fact is, evidenced by this site, that I don''t have all that much free time.  95% of the time, I don''t even spend my lunch hour as hiatus from work.
